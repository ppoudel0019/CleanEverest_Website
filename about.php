     <h2>Who we are: </h2>
<p class="thin">We organize cleaning Champaign events around the Mount Everest area, invite volunteers from around the world and collect funds for organizing these events. With the mountain expeditions growing over the years, the area is turning to be the highest dumpster on Earth. We train volunteers for a month, a team of 15, and takes them to a month-long cleaning climb. Since the weather to climb is only good on some months, there are only 2 teams per year the events are organized. If there are not enough volunteers, Sherpas are hired to fill up the seat for 15 individuals. 
Clean Everest is also working towards organizing a emergency helicopter service for the mountaineers. </p>

<h2> Establishment: </h2> 
<p class="thin">Our organization "Clean Everest" was established in 2015 by mountain climber Sir. Neil Clinton. He climbed the Everest for the first time on 1997, second time on 2005 and third time on 2014. On 2014, he noticed that garbage around the area had increased drastically and wanted to do something to preseve this pristine nature. With the help of Taming Sherpa, Bhusan Sherpa and Tom Hanks he started small events to clean up the area. After being praised for this act interenationally, in 2015, he decided to established an organization dedicated to clean and maintain the area.</p> </br>
